    Que 1:: Diffierence between "==" and "===" operators.
    Ans:: In java script "==" and "===" is a comparision oprators.
          1] == in JavaScript is used for comparing two variables, compare only values
           but it ignores the datatype of variable.
           Ex: console.log(21 == '21');
           output: true;
 
          2]  === is used for comparing two variables,
          but this operator also checks datatype and compares two values.
          Ex: console.log(21 == '21');
          output: true;
         
     Que2:: What is spred operator.
            the java script is to allow us to quickly copy all or part of array and object 
            into another array or object
            ex:
            let arr = [1,2,3];
            let arr2 = [4,5]; 
            arr = [...arr,...arr2];
            console.log(arr);
            

     Que3::What is diffierence between var ,let and const
     Ans:: in java sript there are 3 keywords var, let and const.
           var is a global scoped ,let and and const is i blocked scoped
           1] in var, veriable can be updated and re decleared whithin its scope
           2] in let, veriable can be updated but not re decleared whithin its scope
           3] in const, veriable can not be updated  and not re decleared whithin its scope
 
 
     que4::what is execution context.
     Ans:: Execution context is abstract concept of java script where the java script code
           is evalucated an executed.      
           whenever any code is run in JavaScript,its run insidean execution context.
 
     que5::what is first class function.
     Ans ::A programming language is said to have First-class functions if functions in that language
           are treated like other variables. So the functions can be assigned to any other variable or
           passed as an argument or can be returned by another function. JavaScript treat function as 
           a first-class-citizens. This means that functions are simply a value and are just another
           type of object.  
           ex:          
           var sum = function(a, b) {
            return a + b;
          }
          var total = sum(10, 1);
